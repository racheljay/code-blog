你好！ 我叫名字瑞秋。我是美国人。我的朋友是青青。我是中文学生。我的中文不好。对不起。再见！

Hello! My name is Rachel. I am American. My friend is Qingqing. I am a Chinese student. My Chinese is not good. Sorry. Goodbye!

## Learning Mandarin

This is my attempt at stringing together a few sentences in Chinese. I am still learning so it sounds very formal. After getting some feedback from a friend he told me I sounded like an AI (lol) and this would be a more natural way to say the above statement. I'm going to put it down below just for my own studying purposes. Hopefully I can look back at this post after more studying and make more sense of it.

朋友们好！我叫瑞秋。来自美国。我有一个(男)朋友叫青青。(<- sounds weird to say here) 我刚开始学习中文所以中文不是很好。
